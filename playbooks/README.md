## Components made up Ansible

- `inventory` (list of devices that we will be controlling)
- `roles` (core components that define the automation tasks)
- `playbook` (automation task definition)
- `module` (pre-defined task template that can be called upon automation)
- `variable` (user-defined custom variables that can be injected to Ansible automation)
- `ansible.cfg` (modify default behavior and settings that Ansible uses)

## Automation and Orchestration

- Automation refers to a single task
- Orchestration refers to the management of many automated tasks
- Often a complicated ordering with dependencies

## Installation

```bash
# osx
brew install ansible
# archlinux
sudo pacman -S ansible

# verify installation
ansible --version
```

## Playbook

#### Run a normal playbook against the default hosts

```bash
ansible-playbook [playbook path]
```

#### Run a playbook against an inventory list

```bash
ansible-playbook -i [inventory path] [role path]
```

#### Run a pre-defined module against hosts

E.g. Run the ping module

```bash
ansible [hostfile path] -m ping
```

#### Run a Task with sudo – Ansible become

sudo is to execute a task as a root user, in other words, we call it as privileged execution. If you want to execute a certain task as the root user using ansible just `become` is sufficient

Consider the following playbook where I want to install and restart the apache httpd server and I have used only the become method cause I know the default `become_user` is root and it does not have to be mentioned

```yaml
---
- name: Playbook
  ...
  become: yes
  ...
```

#### Ansible become with password

reference: https://www.middlewareinventory.com/blog/ansible-sudo-ansible-become-example/

Consider the same playbook given below for this the only difference we are going to do is passing the password as a parameter while invoking the playbook

How to pass the password as a parameter. ansible-playbook gives you to two options or parameters to pass while you are invoking the playbook

`-K` or `--ask-become-pass`

```bash
ansible-playbook -K [playbook path]
```

Alternative way to run playbook with `--ask-become-pass` but without the need to explicitly type `become` password

```bash
ansible-playbook \
  -e ansible_become_pass=$ANSIBLE_PASSWORD \
  [playbook path]
```

#### Enable verbose mode while running the playbook

To understand what is happening when you run the playbook, you can run it with the verbose `-v` option. Every extra v will provide the end user with more debug output.

`-v` or `--verbose`

```bash
ansible-playbook -v [playbook path]
```

## Task

#### Execute a task if it caused a change

Set the `changed_when` parameter as `yes` as the following:

```yaml
changed_when: yes
```

#### Ensure all tasks must complete one one server before proceeding to the next server

Set the `serial` paramter to `1` as the following:

```yaml
serial: 1
```

#### Continuation of the play on a host

For Continuation of the play on a host, without waiting for other hosts, set the `strategy` parameters to the `free` option as the following:

```yaml
strategy: option
```

## Ansible Galaxy

#### Install a collection from Galaxy

reference: https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/galaxy/user_guide.html#installing-a-collection-from-galaxy

```bash
ansible-galaxy collection install community.general --upgrade
```

Alternatively you can include the collection in a `requirements.yml` file and then run `ansible-galaxy collection install -r requirements.yml --upgrade`. Here is an example of `requirements.yml` file:

```yaml
collections:
  - name: kewlfft.aur
  - name: community.general
```
